## Development

If you are curious about the process of the development of this project, please [click here](./documentation/development.md).
<br><br>

## Deployment

### Current Deployment

The website is currently available at:

- [PWeb Solutions (my own hosting)](http://www.pweb.solutions/covidtracker/)
- [GitPages](http://patrickpulfer.github.io/code_institute_Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project/index.html)
- [GitHack](http://raw.githack.com/patrickpulfer/code_institute_Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project/master/index.html)

**Important** You will have to create your own MediaStack & Google API Keys and add those to the main.js file if you wish to deploy this project on your own. Please see the following documentation on how to create one:

- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key
- https://mediastack.com/documentation

I have used the following method to deploy this website at GitPages but may also use this workflow to deploy any websites at GitPages:

1. Navigate to your GitHub Project
2. On top of your project files, there is a menu bar. Click on "Settings"
3. In your settings view, scroll down until the section "GitHub Pages"
4. Here you can choose the Source (preferentially main branch) and Save to deploy
5. Note the URL at "Your site is published at XXXXXX". It will be the URL to share

### Further Deployment

You may deploy this website on your local machine for testing purposes.

On **_Linux_**, you can easily do this on your terminal if you have git installed:

```
cd <to your preferred folder>
git clone https://github.com/patrickpulfer/code_institute_Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project.git

```

To run, simply double-click the index.html file in the target folder or run the following command:

```
xdg-open ./code_institute_Interactive_Frontend_Development_Milestone_Project/index.html
```

Downloading the source code as Zip file from GitHub is also a valid method for **_Linux_** and **_Windows_**. On the project page, look for the Code button with arrow down as shown below:

Note: You have to extract the contents of your .zip file with your OS's decompression tool. [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) is a good alternative.

Once unzipped, look for the index.html file and double-click it.

- I received inspiration for this project from [Worldmeter](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), a website I personally visit almost daily. I hope to contribute to the world by spreading the news and current status of the current pandemic

- My experience in web development has been backend so far (PHP), so this is my first project with data being processed in frontend JavaScript. I reckon my code may not be the most efficient but I am learning thanks to Code Institute <3
